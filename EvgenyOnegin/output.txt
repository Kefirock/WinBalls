Aerials in the sky
Aerials in the sky
Aerials in the sky
Aerials so up high
Aerials so up high
Always wanna go
Always wanna go
Always wanna play
Always wanna play
And one again after the fall
And we are the ones that wanna choose
But you never wanna lose
But you never wanna lose
But you never wanna stay
But you never wanna stay
Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Life is a waterfall
Life is a waterfall
Swimming through the void
Swimming through the void
Then we turn around and put up our walls
We are the ones that wanna choose
We drink from the river
We hear the word
We hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all
We lose ourselves but we find it all
We're one in the river
When you free your eyes eternal prize
When you free your eyes eternal prize
When you lose small mind
When you lose small mind
When you lose small mind
You free your life
You free your life
You free your life
